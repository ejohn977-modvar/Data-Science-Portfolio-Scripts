# credit_fraud_box.ipynb
This is a notebook for resampling the 15 features that are most well correlated with the class labels and then training and XGBoost model for classification. The resampling is a combinatino of under- and over-sampling that is accomplished with the imblearn package in python. I have writen a medium article about this project. This notebook will reproduce the results quoted in that medium article.
