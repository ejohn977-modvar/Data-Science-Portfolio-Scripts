The Notebook "wrangling_and_manipulation" is an example of some of the data wrangling, exploration, and visualization I did using MySQL and Python at InteQ Insights.

The SQL script "hacker_rank_occupations_mysql_script" is a sql script I wrote for a Hacker Rank challenge I recently did to test the freshness of my SQL skills.

The Python script "stock_price_ingestion" was created for a personal project predicting stock price data. It is an example of downloading ticker data from an API and loading it into a PostgreSQL database I created.
